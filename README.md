# Number-Guessing-game
This is a number-guessing game created using basic Front End Technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The user has a total of 10 lives.

In this game, the user has to select any number between 1 to 100. The computer selects a random number from the system. If the number selected by the user matches with the 
one selected by the computer within the given number of lives, the user wins. Else, he/she loses.

The working of the game is segregated into four sections as follows:- 

-> If the number guessed by the user is higher than the number selected, the system lets out a message to select a number less than the number guessed.

-> If the number is lesser than the number selected, the system lets out a message to select a number higher than the number guessed.

-> If the number matches with the one selected by the computer , the user wins. 

-> If the number does not match the number selected by the computer within the given number of lives, the user loses.
